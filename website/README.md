# Skyline Website

The Skyline website (which includes its documentation) is built using
[Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

To work on the website, you need `node` installed on your machine. According to
the Docusaurus docs, you need version 10.15.1 or greater. Run `node -v` to
check which version of node you have installed.


### Installation

```sh
npm install
```


### Local Development

```sh
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.


### Build

```sh
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be
served using any static contents hosting service.
