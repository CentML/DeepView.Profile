## Versioning

Skyline uses semantic versioning. Before the 1.0.0 release, backward
compatibility between minor versions will not be guaranteed.

The Skyline command line tool and plugin use *independent* version numbers.
However, it is very likely that minor and major versions of the command line
tool and plugin will be released together (and hence share major/minor version
numbers).

Generally speaking, the most recent version of the command line tool and plugin
will be compatible with each other.
