## What is Skyline?

Skyline is a tool used with [Atom](https://atom.io) to profile, visualize, and
debug the *computational training performance* of
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) deep neural networks.

What makes Skyline special is that it provides *interactive* performance
profiling. When hovering over visualizations, Skyline will highlight the
line(s) of code associated with that visualization‚Äîmaking it easy to connect
the profiling data to the code. Some of Skyline's visualizations are also
manipulatable. When dragging the throughput or memory visualizations, Skyline
will mutate the code to indicate the batch size that should be used to achieve
these manipulated metrics.

As an in-editor profiling tool, Skyline can help you recognize and diagnose
performance issues during development. Skyline transparently re-profiles your
model in the background as you make changes to ensure that you always get to
see the latest performance data.

Skyline is also a standalone performance profiler. If you do not want to use
the interactive profiling interface, you can also get Skyline to output a file
with its profiling data. See the [Standalone Profiling](standalone.md) page for
more information.

## Why Build Skyline?

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have taken the world by storm. However, using DNNs
in practice can be challenging because they can take a significant amount of
computational resources and time to train.<sup><a href="https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/">1</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02243">2</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01500">3</a></sup>
As a result, there are often times when developers will need to debug and tune
their DNNs for performance. The problem is, doing this debugging and tuning
effectively with existing tools is difficult! It requires intimate knowledge
across the entire software and hardware stack‚Äîsomething that not all deep
learning developers have (or should need).

With Skyline, our goal was to build an easy-to-use tool that is tailored for
deep learning developers. Skyline lets you inspect the computational training
performance of your models directly in your development environment. It shows
domain-specific metrics such as your model's training throughput and memory
footprint. And it supports a variety of additional features such as

- üèñ In-editor computational performance profiling
- üîÆ Interactive code-linked visualizations
- üéà Profiling during development
- üíæ Memory profiling: overall usage and breakdowns
- üõ∞ Remote project profiling support (alpha)

We designed Skyline to be intuitive and fun to use. We hope that you will give
it a try!
