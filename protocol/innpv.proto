// Messages used in the INNPV protocol are defined in this file.
//
// INNPV operates on individual "projects", which are treated as collections of
// conceptually related files under one common directory (the project root
// directory).
//
// All file paths exchanged by the protocol are *relative* to the project root.
// Paths are passed in component form (i.e. without separators) to account for
// different operating systems (e.g., the server could be running on a Linux
// machine whereas the client is running on a Windows machine).
//
// The client and server must individually determine the project root during
// connection establishment. The server implicitly determines the project root
// based on the directory from which the user launches it. The client can
// ask the server for this project root during initialization or can request it
// from the user. Requesting the project root from the user is useful for
// situations where the client is remote (e.g., operating on a mounted network
// file system).
